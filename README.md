# Alphafold
Using Alphafold2 to determine the structure of the CRAMP1 protein
## Background
Through CRSIPR/Cas9-based screening, we identified the previously uncharcaterized protein CRAMP1 as a major factor involved in controlling the sensitivity to two functionally different Topoisomerase II inhibitors (TOP2i), ICRF-193 and ETP. Further exploration revealed that CRAMP1 exerts its protection against these compunds by contorlling linker histone H1 expresison, and thus preventing excessive chromatin decompaction and subsequent TOP2 binding and trapping.

## Aim of the project
We used Alphafold2 to determine CRAMP1 structure and identify domains that could be involved in its role controlling H1 expresison and/or TOP2i sensitivity.
